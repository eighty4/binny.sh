<p>NPM package <span class="pkg">@eighty4/install-template</span> generates installation scripts for GitHub releases.
    The script installs binaries from your latest release to a user's home directory and sets up the user's shell path.</p>
<p>Host the script on your project's website and give your users a command like this:</p>
<p><pre><code>curl -fsSL https://asdf/myscript.sh | sh</code></pre></p>
<p>That's it! You're ready to give it a go.</p>
